<h3>Treasury Depertment</h3>
<p class="lead">
  So let each one give as he purpose in his heart,
  not grudgingly or of necessity for  God Loves a cheerful giver<br>
  <p>1 Corinthians 9:7(NKJV)
</p>
<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-lg-4 abty">
<p style="font-size: 18px;">It's point blank that God is the Master giver. With his mighty example of benevolence John 3:16, 
  we are called by Him as co-labourers in His vineyard to closely follow His prints.
  There is much satisfaction and joy in giving. Blessings attached to the act are 
  infinite.2 Corinthians 9:7
  With the same, Generosity Colossians 1:16-17 and the love of God 2 Corinthians 5:14 we are called to go on God's errands.
  "Every man of us is facing inevitable and eternal bankruptcy, except as he invests his life and his treasure in something spiritual: for only spiritual things can abide forever "- W. Brown, Gems of Thought on tithing( Cincinnati: Jenning and Graham, 19110,23 )
  This is as plain as the day. Investing in the course of God, the reward is eternal.
  The counsel from the pen of inspiration says that;
  </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-lg-4 abty">
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
     God's word must be our guide as to the conditions that are specified by which we may become
      laborers together with Christ. The desire to accumulate wealth is an original affection of 
      our nature, implanted there by our Heavenly Father for noble ends. If you ask the capitalist
       who has directed all his energies to the one object of securing wealth, and who is
        persevering and industrious to add to his property, with what design he thus labors, he could not give you a reason for this, a definite purpose for which he is gaining earthly treasures and heaping up riches. He cannot define any great aim or purpose he has in view, or any new source of happiness he expects to attain. He goes on accumulating because he has turned all his abilities and all his powers in this direction. There is within the worldly man a craving for something that he does not have. He has, from force of habit, bent every thought, every purpose in the direction of making provision for the future, and as he grows older, he becomes more eager than ever to acquire all that it is possible to gain. It is natural that the covetous man should become more covetous as he draws near the time when he is losing hold upon all earthly things. All this energy, this perseverance, this determination, this industry after earthly power is the result of the perversion of his powers to a wrong object. Every faculty might have been cultivated to the highest possible elevation by exercise, for the heavenly, immortal life, and for the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The customs and practices of the worldly man in his perseverance and his energies, and in availing himself of every opportunity to add to his store, should be a lesson to those who claim to be children of God, seeking for glory, honor, and immortality. The children of the world are wiser in their generation than the children of the light, and herein is seen their wisdom. Their object is for earthly gain, and to this end they direct all their energies. Oh that this zeal would characterize the toiler for heavenly riches!
 Review and Heralds March 1,  1887, par. 9

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
The Lord's Church, will only stand, meet her missionary goals to reach and
 save souls if only there will be faithfulness in tithing and offering.
 A renowned writer once said in one of his scripts;
" Poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue; it is hard for an empty bag to stand upright." Brownlow,37 
The degree of truth in this claim is very high and the Church of Christ is not immune to to poverty which whereby it can't stand. When we will count our blessings one by one, and by the grace of God accept them in our lives, only then, will there be a greater revival in the present church than that which existed in ancient times of Israelites that built
 the Sanctuary in the Wilderness.
Will you be the one to stand for Jesus. To prosper His course?
 Brownlow,39 " It is significant that when public opinion turned against Jesus, and He was executed, that when other disciples feared and ran,the one who had enough courage and a heart to give Jesus a considerate and beautiful burial was a rich man."
The man was Joseph himself. Son of Arimathea. None is so poor that they can't give, nor too rich that they can't lose. We are called to give.
Hear is given of a story,
A certain man in the hilly country in Jerusalem kept donkeys in his yard. Then one fine morning came the disciples of Jesus whom He sent, to go and bring the colt for the Son of David to ride upon. The owner of the colt was not to deter them from untying the colt. Because then, the disciples were told to reply," The Owner has sent us to Untie the Colt." The story ends in a  powerful way. When the colt was returned after the Master Jesus has rode on it, what a blessing that followed the farmer. Thousands and thousands of tourists came to the humble home to see the colt that the King Jesus rode on and decided to pay the family tourist fee, built a monument there, and the family transited from dungeon to palace.
God bless you fellow steward.
